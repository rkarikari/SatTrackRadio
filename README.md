## Installation

Install on your android phone. 

#### Permissions Required
- `BLUETOOTH` - For radio control
- `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` - For Bluetooth device pairing
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` - For GPS functionality
- `INTERNET` - For TLE and transponder updates

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Set Your Location**
   - Navigate to the Location tab
   - Enter coordinates manually or use GPS (Android)
   - Save your location

2. **Add Satellites**
   - Go to Satellites tab
   - Click "Add" to download from catalog
   - Select satellites you want to track
   - TLEs and transponders are automatically downloaded

3. **Track a Satellite**
   - Select a satellite from the list
   - Click "Start Tracking"
   - View real-time position and Doppler data

4. **Connect Radio** (Optional)
   - Go to Radio Control tab
   - Select radio type (FT-818 or TH-D74)
   - Choose Bluetooth device (Previously paired devices)
   - Click "Connect"

5. **Enable Auto-Tracking**
   - Check "Enable Doppler Correction"
   - Check "Auto Update Radio"
   - Select update mode (RX/TX/Both)
   - Radio will automatically adjust frequencies during passes

### Radio Control Modes

#### RX Only Mode
Updates only the receive frequency (downlink). Ideal for monitoring satellites.

#### TX Only Mode
Updates only the transmit frequency (uplink). For simplex operations.

#### Both RX/TX Mode
Full duplex operation with split frequencies. Automatically manages both uplink and downlink with Doppler correction.

### Pass Predictions

1. Navigate to Passes tab
2. Select satellite (or "All Satellites")
3. Click "Predict Passes"
4. View upcoming passes sorted by AOS time
5. Passes with high elevation are highlighted

### GPS Time Synchronization

For maximum accuracy in Doppler calculations:

1. Go to Location tab
2. Click "Get GPS Location & Time"
3. Wait for GPS fix
4. Check "Use GPS Time"
5. GPS provides atomic clock accuracy for time-sensitive operations

## Configuration

### Settings Options

- **Minimum Elevation**: Set minimum angle for pass predictions (0-90¬∞)
- **Prediction Period**: Hours to predict ahead (1-168 hours)
- **Update Interval**: Position update frequency (1-60 seconds)
- **Auto-update TLEs**: Automatically refresh TLEs on startup
- **TLE Source**: Choose Celestrak category
- **Auto-connect Radio**: Connect to last used radio on startup

## Technical Details

### Orbital Mechanics
- **SGP4 propagator** with full perturbation theory
- **Geodetic coordinate conversion** with WGS-84 ellipsoid
- **Look angle calculations** in SEZ (South-East-Zenith) frame
- **Greenwich Sidereal Time** calculations for ECI to ECEF conversion

### Doppler Correction

- Corrects for satellite velocity along line of sight
- Separate calculations for uplink and downlink
- Real-time updates based on range rate

### CAT Protocol

#### FT-818
- Binary CAT commands
- BCD frequency encoding
-
- Frequency resolution: Hardware Specs

#### TH-D74
- ASCII command protocol
- Dual-band operation (Band A/B)
-

## Default Satellites

Includes sample pre-configured TLEs and transponders for:
- AO-92 (FOX-1D) - Fox-1D
- Always download the Latest


## Data Sources

- **TLEs**: Celestrak (https://celestrak.org)
- **Transponders**: SatNOGS Database (https://db.satnogs.org)

## Troubleshooting

### TLE Updates Fail
- Check internet connection
- Verify HTTPS connectivity

### Radio Connection Issues
- Verify Bluetooth pairing
- The app only lists devices from bluetooth "paired" in android settings.
- Check radio is in CAT control mode
- For FT-818: Ensure correct baud rate (9600 )
  

### GPS Not Working (Android)
- Grant location permissions
- Enable location services
- Ensure clear sky view
- Wait 30-60 seconds for initial fix

### Doppler Correction Inaccurate
- Update TLEs (older than 7 days may be inaccurate)
- Use GPS time synchronization
- Verify observer location is correct
